# gaussian elimination
1.First, we selected an equation involving x (possibly with some coefficient) and scaled it to make the x
coefficient unity.
2.Then, we added multiples of this equation from all the other equations to eliminate x, producing a
system with one fewer unknown and one fewer equation.
3.We then repeated the first two steps until we arrived at an equation with exactly one unknown, which
we could solve directly
4.Finally, we substituted the known value of the final unknown into a previous equation to recover the
last two unknowns, and continued substituting until we recovered all of our unknowns!
