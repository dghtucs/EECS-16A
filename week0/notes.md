Teachers really give me a huge surprise,for my teachers never told me these.

I'm not blaming them for this,because they were not told these genuine words when they were undergraduate like me.
it's the atmosphere,we don't have such an environment here,We use education as a means of weeding out others.So it's difficult to cultivate such a good thing.
